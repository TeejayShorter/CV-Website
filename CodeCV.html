			<p> I'm a recent graduate looking for full-time work in a development role. I have a passion for technology and gaming which has led me to following a life-long dream to develop my own applications. Aspiring to develop my skills, gain more knowledge and work with teams of influential individuals to start a long and successful career. I have gained strong programming logic capabilities which have had a positive influence on how well my application developing skills have progressed. My graphic design and games development background has also given me a keen sense of detail which is often reflected in my work. I would like to put my skills to use in real world projects to help give me some more industry related experience. </p>

				<p> Over the years of working for Sports Direct, I have immersed myself heavily in customer service and ensuring the happiness of my co-workers. I have worked in multiple stores during my time and taken on more responsibility with each year of experience. My job has always been my passion and I have strived to make the department a better place. From doing this, I have gained some valuable skills such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Managing a team -</b> Delegating jobs, maintaining standards, providing order, covering shifts, dealing with lateness and providing weekly feedback to the store manager on the departments' situation</li>
					<li><b>Money Management -</b> Serving on the tills, counting up the floats at the end of the day as well as checking money discrepancies on the system for any overages</li>
					<li><b>Customer Service -</b> Helping customers to make correct choices with shoes, providing relevant information to customers in a non-technical manor and dealing with customer queries/complaints</li>
					<li><b>Merchandising -</b> Ensuring the products are displayed to the companies compliance standards</li>
				</ul>
